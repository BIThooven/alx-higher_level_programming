# Python Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Main Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. Understand the concept of Object Relational Mapping (ORM) and its benefits.
2. Learn how to use an ORM library in Python to interact with a relational database.
3. Gain proficiency in performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using ORM.
4. Explore the different ORM features such as model definition, query generation, and database migrations.
5. Understand the importance of database relationships and how to define them using ORM.
6. Learn how to handle database transactions and ensure data integrity.
7. Gain knowledge of advanced ORM concepts such as lazy loading, eager loading, and caching.
8. Practice writing efficient and optimized database queries using ORM.
9. Understand the security considerations when using ORM and how to prevent common vulnerabilities.
10. Explore the best practices and design patterns for using ORM effectively in Python projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install the required ORM library (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Django ORM).
2. Set up a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Configure the ORM library to connect to the database.
4. Define your models and their relationships.
5. Perform CRUD operations using the ORM library.
6. Test and validate your code to ensure proper functionality.
7. Optimize and refactor your code as needed.
8. Document your code and provide clear instructions for others to understand and use.
